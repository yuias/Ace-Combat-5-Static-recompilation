/* ac5mod.h -- what a mod is written against.
 *
 * This is the whole surface.  A mod reaches the game through the calls below
 * in one of two ways:
 *
 *   Lua      a .lua file in the mod's directory.  The `ac5` table it sees is
 *            this header, call for call (runtime/src/ps2_lua.c).
 *   native   a DLL in the mod's directory exporting
 *                int ac5_mod_main(const ac5_api *api);
 *            loaded only when the mod's manifest says `native = true`.  Native
 *            code is arbitrary code in the game's process; the log says which
 *            mods ran some.
 *
 * THE MACHINE UNDERNEATH.  The game is not emulated here: its functions were
 * translated to C ahead of time and are ordinary native code in this process.
 * What a mod manipulates is the guest's *state* -- its 32 MB of memory and its
 * register file -- through a context pointer that every hook receives.
 *
 * ADDRESSES ARE STABLE.  A guest address means the same thing in every build:
 * the executable it came from is pinned by SHA-256, so 0x0011DB30 is the same
 * function next year as today.  config/game_symbols.txt names the functions
 * the game's own debug messages identify, and symbol() looks names up.
 *
 * WHICH THREAD.  Everything here except log() must happen on a thread that
 * holds the EE: in ac5_mod_main, a hook, or any callback below -- which is
 * everywhere a mod's code is called from.  A call from any other thread is
 * refused and counted.
 *
 * PRIORITY.  A mod's manifest priority settles every conflict: two mods
 * replacing one file, one function, one indirect-call target, one memory
 * patch, one named parameter -- the higher priority wins, both are logged.
 *
 * COMPATIBILITY.  Fields are only ever appended.  A module built against this
 * header runs on any runtime whose abi_version is at least AC5_ABI_VERSION, so
 * check `api->abi_version >= AC5_ABI_VERSION`, not equality.
 *
 * HANDLES.  Everything that attaches something returns a handle > 0, or -1
 * with the reason in the log: hooks go back through unhook(), callbacks and
 * timers through cancel(), patches through unpatch().
