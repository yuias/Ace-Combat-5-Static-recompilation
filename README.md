# ps2recomp: Ace Combat 5

A static recompilation of **Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War** (PS2, NTSC-U) for Windows.

The game's main CPU code isn't emulated. A Python tool reads the original executable and translates every function into C ahead of time. GCC then compiles that together with a runtime that stands in for the rest of the console: the GS (drawn through Vulkan), the VU vector units, SPU2 audio, the IPU for the movies, the IOP modules, memory cards and controllers. What you get at the end is a normal `ac5.exe`.

The graphics are native too. The 3D (the aircraft, the cockpit, terrain, ground objects, the sky and clouds) doesn't go through an emulated Graphics Synthesizer. The vector programs the game runs on the VU1 to transform and light its models have been rewritten as native code, and the geometry is drawn as real GPU meshes, with vertex shaders, mipmapped textures and anisotropic filtering. The flight HUD, the radar and the radio captions are drawn at your window's resolution, so they stay sharp at any size. Whatever the native renderer doesn't cover yet (the menus, the hangar, some effects) still goes through the emulated GS, into the same frame.

The game is fully playable.

There's no game code or assets in this repo. You bring your own copy of the game and the recompiler builds the C code from it on your machine, which is also why `generated/` is in `.gitignore`.

## What you need

- **The game.** The US release, serial SLUS-20851, as an ISO or as the extracted disc files. Other regions won't work because the config files are tied to addresses in the US executable.
- **64-bit Windows** and a GPU with a Vulkan driver. I build and play on Windows 10.
- **[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org)**, for GCC and SDL3. In the MSYS2 UCRT64 shell run:

  ```
  pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-sdl3 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-pkgconf
  ```

  It has to be GCC 15 or newer. The generated code relies on guaranteed tail calls (`[[gnu::musttail]]`), and with an older compiler you get a CMake warning and an exe that can run out of stack.

  If you'd rather not install MSYS2, there's a Clang build instead, see [Building with Clang](#building-with-clang-no-msys2) under step 4.
- **CMake** 3.20 or newer, and **Ninja** (`pip install ninja` is the easiest way to get it).
- **The [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com)**. The build uses its `glslc` to compile the shaders.
- **Python 3.** Only the standard library is used, there's nothing to pip install. I'm on 3.12.

## Step 1: get the executable off the disc

The recompiler only needs one file from the disc, `SLUS_208.51`, which is the game's main executable. It's in the root of the ISO. Mount the ISO in Explorer (double-click it) or open it with 7-Zip, and copy that file somewhere.

Make sure it's the right one before going any further:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\SLUS_208.51 -Algorithm SHA256
```

You should get:

```
C3594227605307806592416DBD723BF5771952E279EE281A40DA305426667385
```

The file should also be exactly 3,634,092 bytes. If the hash doesn't match, stop here. You've got a different region or a modified executable, and the recompile won't line up with the config files.

Keep the ISO around. The executable is just the code, the game still loads its models, textures, sound and movies off the disc while you play.

## Step 2: set up a terminal

Everything from here on is PowerShell, run from the root of this repo. Put MSYS2's UCRT64 `bin` folder at the front of your PATH first, so CMake can find `gcc` and `pkg-config`:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;$env:PATH"
```

That only applies to the window you're in. Change the path if MSYS2 isn't installed in `C:\msys64`. If you only just installed the Vulkan SDK, open a new terminal so it picks up the `VULKAN_SDK` variable.

## Step 3: recompile

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "tools"
python -m ps2recomp "C:\path\to\SLUS_208.51" -o generated `
    --ida-db config/ida_db.json `
    --ida-seeds config/ida_seeds.json `
    --symbols config/sdk_symbols.json `
    --symbols config/manual_symbols.json `
    --overrides config/overrides.json `
    --hooks config/hooks.json
```

This takes about 15 seconds, and the last line should be:

```
emitted 10742 functions into 43 files in 15.0s
```

(the time will be different for you). That gives you a `generated/` folder of about 50 MB:

- `ps2_code_0000.c` through `ps2_code_0042.c`: the recompiled functions
- `ps2_func_table.c` and `ps2_funcs.h`: the address to function table the runtime dispatches through
- `ps2_symbols.c`: names for the functions that have one
- `ps2_image.bin`: the executable's memory image, which the runtime loads at startup (`ps2_image.c` just records where it goes and how big it is)

Use all of those flags. There's a shorter version with only `--ida-db` sitting in an error message in `CMakeLists.txt`, don't go by that one. It does produce code that compiles, but it leaves out the overrides and hooks, and the game won't work without them. The overrides replace SDK functions that talk to hardware the PC doesn't have (SIF RPC, the CD drive, the pads and so on) with native handlers in `runtime/src/ps2_hle_*.c`. Recompile those faithfully and the game just sits there waiting on hardware that never answers.

The rest, in short:

- `ida_db.json` and `ida_seeds.json` are function boundaries and entry points exported from IDA. When I tested the recompiler on the SDK sample programs, it found roughly two thirds of the functions on its own and about 97% with the IDA data.
- `sdk_symbols.json` names the PS2 SDK functions linked into the game, found by signature matching. `manual_symbols.json` is the handful the matcher couldn't place.
- `hooks.json` hangs native handlers off a few of the game's own functions (scene changes, file opens, sound loading, the radio queue). They run first, then the original code carries on as normal.

If you want to actually read the output, add `--comments`. Every line then gets the original MIPS instruction written next to it. The files come out about half again as big, but the code is exactly the same.

## Step 4: build

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build/gcc -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/gcc.exe `
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/c++.exe
cmake --build build/gcc
```

The shaders get compiled into a `shaders` folder right next to `ac5.exe`, and that's where the game looks for them. If you ever move the exe somewhere else, take that folder with it.

Give it some time. Every generated file is basically one gigantic function and GCC takes its time with them. It takes me 3 to 5 minutes on a 12-thread CPU. There shouldn't be any warnings.

When it's done you'll have:

- `build/gcc/ac5.exe`: the game
- `build/gcc/shaders/`: the compiled shaders
- `build/gcc/gsreplay.exe`: a dev tool that replays graphics captures, not needed to play

### Building with Clang (no MSYS2)

`tools/build-clang.ps1` builds with [llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) (Clang plus the mingw-w64 runtime) instead of MSYS2's GCC. On the first run it downloads llvm-mingw and the SDL3 mingw development package into `deps/`, which is git-ignored. You still need CMake, Ninja and the Vulkan SDK. From the repo root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build-clang.ps1
```

The output goes to `build/clang` instead of `build/gcc`, and the script copies `SDL3.dll` and `libwinpthread-1.dll` next to `ac5.exe`, so it starts from anywhere. Extra arguments are passed on to the CMake configure step, for example `-DPS2_DIAG=ON`.

## Step 5: play

Still in the repo root:

```powershell
.\build\gcc\ac5.exe --data generated --disc "C:\path\to\Ace Combat 5 - The Unsung War (USA) (En,Ja).iso" --watchdog 0
```

- `--data` is the folder that has `ps2_image.bin` in it, so `generated`.
- `--disc` takes the ISO or a folder with the extracted disc.
- `--watchdog 0` switches the watchdog off. Normally the runtime gives up if the game hasn't delivered a frame in 10 seconds. That's useful when something's hung during debugging, not so much when you're playing.

The window stays black for about 20 seconds before the first picture. That's normal, give it a moment. The log goes to stderr. In PowerShell 7 you can save it by sticking `2> ac5_log.txt` on the end. The older Windows PowerShell 5.1 mangles stderr when you redirect it like that, so if that's what you have, run the same command from `cmd` instead. `--verbose` makes it log a lot more (and it really is a lot).

If you start `ac5.exe` from anywhere other than that terminal (double-clicking it in Explorer, say), Windows won't be able to find the SDL3 and pthread DLLs. Copy `SDL3.dll` and `libwinpthread-1.dll` from `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` into `build\gcc`, next to `ac5.exe`, and it'll start from anywhere. `vulkan-1.dll` already comes with your graphics driver. Keep in mind it still needs `--data` and `--disc`, so a shortcut with those arguments filled in is the easiest way to launch it outside a terminal.

Where your stuff goes:

- Saves are written to a `saves` folder inside whatever folder you started the game from. The memory card files get created the first time the game touches them. Set `PS2_SAVE_DIR` if you want them somewhere else. These are this runtime's own format, not PCSX2 memory cards, so you can't bring saves over from an emulator.
- Settings are saved to `ac5_settings.ini` next to `ac5.exe`.
- Compiled graphics pipelines are cached in `ac5_pipelines.cache` and `ac5_pipelines.keys` next to `ac5.exe`, so a state that was compiled once doesn't cause a stutter the next time it shows up. Deleting them is harmless, they just get rebuilt.

### Controls

Controllers go through SDL, so anything SDL recognizes as a gamepad should just work. Buttons map by position: the bottom face button is Cross, right is Circle, left is Square, top is Triangle. Bumpers are L1/R1, triggers are L2/R2, clicking the sticks gives L3/R3, and Back and Start are Select and Start.

Keyboard defaults:

| PS2 | Keyboard |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad | Arrow keys |
| Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle | X, S, Z, A |
| L1, R1 | Q, E |
| L2, R2 | 1, 3 |
| Left stick | Numpad 8, 4, 2, 6 (W also works for up) |
| Start, Select | Enter, Right Shift |

You can rebind all of it in the settings menu.

Other keys:

- **F4** opens and closes the settings menu
- **F11** or **Alt+Enter** toggles fullscreen
- **Esc** quits, or closes the settings menu if it's open
- **F6 to F10** are debugging hotkeys (captures and state dumps), you can ignore them

## Mods

Mods go in a `mods` folder in whatever folder you start the game from, one folder per mod. Nothing gets repacked or rebuilt. The game reads its files through a layered file system, and a mod is just another layer on top of the disc. That works the same with the ISO and with extracted disc files.

A mod can:

- replace files, including files inside `DATA.PAC`, by dropping them in its `files/` folder under the name the game uses for them
- change the game's named tuning values with a `params.txt`
- apply PCSX2 `.pnach` patches that change data (code patches can't work on recompiled code, and get refused with a message)
- run Lua scripts that hook the game's functions, read and write its memory, react to frames and scene changes, and rewrite the controller input
- run native code from a DLL, but only if its `mod.toml` says `native = true`

`mods/README.md` explains all of it. The Lua API is `runtime/include/ac5mod.h`, and that header stays documented on purpose.

To name files inside `DATA.PAC` you need `config/pac_names.txt`, which is already in the repo. If you want to rebuild it, `python -m modkit.export_names` generates it from `datapack.bin` in the PS4 release. `python -m modkit extract` pulls files out of the archive under the same names, so you have something to start from. Both need `PYTHONPATH` pointing at `tools`.

If the game misbehaves, set `PS2_NO_MODS=1` first. That turns the whole mod layer off, and if the problem is still there, it isn't a mod. `PS2_MOD_DIR` loads mods from a different folder. The log ends with a summary of every mod, conflict, hook and patch.

`tests/mods` has the mods I test the mod layer with. `python tools/make_test_mods.py` adds the ones that need files from your own disc, because those can't be in the repo.

## Optional: recompile the VU1 microprograms as well

The PS2's VU1 runs small vector programs that the game uploads to it while it's running. They aren't in the executable as code, so `ps2recomp` never sees them. The ones the native renderer has replaced never run at all, and by default the runtime interprets the rest. You can record the ones the game really uses and compile those to C too, which is faster for whatever the native renderer doesn't cover yet.

1. Record them. Set the census variable and play like normal:

   ```powershell
   $env:PS2_VU_CENSUS = "1"
   .\build\gcc\ac5.exe --data generated --disc "C:\path\to\game.iso" --watchdog 0
   ```

   Get through the menus and into a mission, because some of the programs only get uploaded once you're actually flying. A short run that never leaves the menus only records the menu programs. Quit with Esc when you're done, and on the way out it writes `out\vu_programs\` (a `manifest.json` plus a `.bin` for each program).

2. Turn them into C. `PYTHONPATH` still needs to point at `tools` for this:

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item Env:PS2_VU_CENSUS
   python -m vurecomp --programs out/vu_programs -o generated/ps2_vu1_progs.inc
   ```

   `python -m vurecomp --programs out/vu_programs --stats` shows what got recorded, if you're curious.

3. Rebuild. There's a catch here: Ninja won't notice the new file on its own, because `ps2_vu.c` only includes it if it exists and nothing depended on it before. A plain `cmake --build` just says "no work to do". Touch `ps2_vu.c` first so it gets recompiled:

   ```powershell
   (Get-Item runtime\src\ps2_vu.c).LastWriteTime = Get-Date
   cmake --build build/gcc
   ```

Next time the game draws something with the VU1, the log should get a line like `vu1: 15 recompiled microprograms available` (15 is what a census through a full mission gave me, yours depends on how far you played). If you ever want to compare against the interpreter, set `PS2_VU_RECOMP=0`.

## Regenerating the config files

You don't need to. Everything in `config/` is already generated and committed, so you don't need IDA or the PS2 SDK to build. If you want to redo them anyway:

- `tools/ida/export_db.py` and `tools/ida/export_seeds.py` are IDA scripts that produce `ida_db.json` and `ida_seeds.json`.
- `tools/identify_sdk.py` rebuilds `sdk_symbols.json` by matching the game against the SDK's EE libraries. Point `PS2SDK_DIR` at your SDK and `AC5_DISC` at the extracted disc folder first.

## What's in here

- `tools/ps2recomp/`: the recompiler (ELF in, C out)
- `tools/vurecomp/`: the VU1 microprogram recompiler
- `tools/`: test and check scripts
- `runtime/`: everything that stands in for the console, plus the settings menu and the mod layer
- `runtime/src/rn/`: the native renderer
- `runtime/shaders/`: the GLSL shaders, compiled at build time
- `config/`: the IDA export, symbol tables, overrides and hooks
- `third_party/imgui/`: Dear ImGui, used for the settings menu
- `third_party/lua/`: Lua 5.4.9, used for mod scripts
- `tools/modkit/`: reads `DATA.PAC` by file name
- `mods/`: where mods go, see `mods/README.md`
- `tests/mods/`: the mods the mod layer is tested with
- `generated/`: the recompiler's output, which you create in step 3

## Troubleshooting

- **CMake says `Cannot find source file: .../generated/ps2_func_table.c`.** You haven't done step 3 yet, or the output went somewhere other than `generated`.
- **CMake can't find Vulkan, `sdl3` or `glslc`.** Either the PATH line from step 2 didn't run in that window, the MSYS2 packages or the Vulkan SDK aren't installed, or the terminal was already open when you installed the SDK.
- **CMake warns that the compiler has no musttail attribute.** Your GCC is too old, you need 15 or newer.
- **ac5.exe won't start and complains about a missing DLL.** See the DLL note in step 5.
- **The log says `vk: cannot open shader`.** The `shaders` folder isn't next to `ac5.exe` anymore. Put it back, or set `PS2_SHADER_DIR` to wherever the `.spv` files are.
- **The game quits by itself with `==== WATCHDOG: the guest delivered no field for 10 seconds`.** You left out `--watchdog 0`.
